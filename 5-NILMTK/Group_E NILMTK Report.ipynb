    "## Introduction\n",
    "Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring is an approach for the energy disaggregation which aims to help to predict individual appliances power and their behavior through the whole household power meter. One can directly conclude that there is no need of the individual sensors, which makes NILM a cheaper alternative to monitoring appliances. Secondly, this helps to reduce energy consumption, save money, find and flatten peak power loads and, finally, go to sustainability. \n",

    "In this project we are going to explore NILMTK Python-framework through the UKDALE dataset to perform energy disaggregation. "

    "The next task is to print out the sub-metered appliances in each building. Here we can see all submeters attached to appliances for each building separately. We conclude that each building has exactly one main meter there are no nested MeterGroups for appliances. Each submeter contains information about its instance, building, as well as appliance (type and instance).\n",

    "CO models each appliance to consist of a fixed number of states and assigns different power levels to each of these states. The optimisation function involves finding the optimal combination of appliance states for different appliances which minimises the difference between predicted and observed aggregate power. In FHMM, each appliance is modelled as a hidden Markov model (HMM), where the hidden component is its state, and the observed component is its power draw. Like CO, FHMM has time complexity exponential in the number of appliances and thus become intractable for a large number of appliances. [\"If You Measure It, Can You Improve It? Exploring The Value of Energy Disaggregation\" - Nipun Batra, et al.].\n",

    "\n",
    "Until the calculating F-score we mainly used a sample code from the NILMTK documentation as for the reference for the model training and evaluation. Below the relevant steps are summarised:\n",
    "*  Train the model on the training set\n",
    "*  Read test data by chunks, apply the model to calculate predicted appliance power in the `pred` and ground truth data in the `gt`\n",
    "*  Try to fit the data into the main memory by concatenating chunks into a pandas dataframe\n",
    "*  Correspond data with the local timezone and put human-readable labels\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are using F1 score the model evaluation, we transfer from the energy disaggregation to the classification problem. Hence, if the predicted power is more than a threshold, the device is classified as ON. \n",
    "\n",
    "F1 score is defined as a harmonic mean of the precision and recall metrics in the binary classification problem. \n",
    "Later we will explain the choice of the threshold value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here one can see F-scores for the individual appliance level using CO and FHMM algorithms. CO performed significantly better for the kettle classification, showing F-score of 0.016418 against 0.009945. It also showed slightly higher F-metric for the Electric space heater and the Laptop computer but not that significant. In contrast, FHMM has an F-score of 0.091067 for the projector versus 0.087560 by CO but the diffence is very small. Thus, we conclude that Combinatorial Optimisation performed better.\n",
    "Now why we chose a threshold of 5. It was actually retrieved empirically since a valud of 0 yielded inadequate results:\n",
