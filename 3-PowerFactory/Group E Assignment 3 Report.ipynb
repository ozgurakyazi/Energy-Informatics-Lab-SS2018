PowerFactory is one of their software product which has ability to analyze transmission, distribution, and industrial electrical power systems. The main objective of this tool is to help planning and operation optimisation. In this exercise we are working with Medium Voltage distribution system structure  to implement configuration checking, planning, and optimising.\n",

This solution enables a Python script to have access to a comprehensive range of data available in PowerFactory, including all objects, attributes, commands, and functions. To gain access to the PowerFactory environment the command GetApplication() must be added."

    "We can understand whether this network is radial or not by checking the rows of this matrix. If there are 2 or more 1s in a row, it means that there are 2 source nodes for the corresponding node. From this, we conclude that there are multiple paths to the same node, so the radiality is violated. Also if there is a closed loop, there has to be a 2 source nodes for a node. Only one exception to this is i.e 1(root)->2->3->1 , root node has an incoming node. In our case, this is impossible. So, whenever there is a closed loop in the network, there are at least 2 incoming nodes for one node.\n",

Meanwhile, in the shortest possible time, the grid must be restored that could feed all transformers. In this scenario we switch line(4) off until the end of this exercise. Line(4) connects  20 kV Substation 4 with trafoSubstations 9 and 17. Hence we need to find a way around, e.g., by not disabling R8. We should also take into account line's length and its load.
