    "DIgSILENT stands for \"__DI__gital __SI__mu__L__ation of __E__lectrical __N__e__T__works\", a software and consulting company providing engineering services in the field of electrical power systems for transmission, distribution, generation and industrial plants. PowerFactory is one of their software product which has ability to analyze transmission, distribution, and industrial electrical power systems. The main objective of this tool is to help planning and operation optimisation. In this exercise we are working with Medium Voltage distribution system structure  to implement configuration checking, planning, and optimising.\n",

    "PowerFactory have API that can have interface with python script by using “powerfactory” module. This solution enables a Python script to have access to a comprehensive range of data available in PowerFactory, including all objects, attributes, commands, and functions. To gain access to the PowerFactory environment the command GetApplication() must be added."

    "We can understand whether this network is radial or not by checking the rows of this matrix. If there are 2 or more 1s in a row, it means that there are 2 source nodes for the corresponding node. From this, we conclude that there are multiple paths to the same node, so the radiality is violated. Also if there is a closed loop, there has to be a 2 source nodes for a node. Only one exception to this is i.e 1(root)->2->3->1 , root node has an incoming node. In our case, this is impossible. So, whenever there is a closed loop in the network, there are at least 2 incoming nodes for one node.\n",

    "However, to understand the if the the problem with radiality or a closed loop, one has to investigate further, since this algorithm only checks if it is radial or not, does not give a clue about closed loops."
